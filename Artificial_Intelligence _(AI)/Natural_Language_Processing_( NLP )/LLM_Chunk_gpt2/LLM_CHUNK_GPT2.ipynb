Here are some key transformer models and variants that have been developed since then:\n",

        "2. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)\n",
        "Developed by OpenAI, GPT models (like GPT-2 and GPT-3) are autoregressive models primarily used for text generation.\n",
        "3. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)\n",
        "Treats every NLP task as a text-to-text problem, making it very flexible across various applications.\n",
        "4. RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)\n",
        "An improvement over BERT with more training data and different training strategies.\n",
        "5. XLNet\n",
        "Combines the ideas of BERT and autoregressive models, allowing for better capturing of context and dependencies.\n",
        "6. ALBERT (A Lite BERT)\n",
        "A smaller and more efficient version of BERT that reduces the number of parameters while maintaining performance.\n",
        "7. DistilBERT\n",
        "A distilled version of BERT that is smaller and faster while retaining much of its performance.\n",

        "Uses a disentangled attention mechanism to improve performance on various NLP tasks.\n",
        "11. Vision Transformers (ViT)\n",
        "Adapts the transformer architecture for image processing tasks, treating images as sequences of patches.\n",
